# phishing-templates

These templates are created for educational purposes only.
Please do not use these for any attempts to phish actual person.

## Usage

You can use the send.py to send the emails in the template through Google's SMTP server (This isn't the best way to send phishing emails in real-life. Again, this is just for educational purposes, so it will suffice for our purpose).

Run send.py using the command below

`python3 send.py`

Fill out the form. For the password, you will need to use an App Password instead of your normal password.
Please see the following links on how to create an App Password (https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833#zippy=%2Cwhy-you-may-need-an-app-password%2Capp-passwords-revoked-after-password-change%2Cforgot-your-app-password).
